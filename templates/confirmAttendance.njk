<p>A <strong>Yes</strong> means that you will be participating in the hackathon. <em>Please only select yes if you are attending the event</em>. If you select yes and do not attend, not only will you deny another hacker an opportunity to participate, but it may have implications on your acceptance to future RevolutionUCs. A <strong>No</strong> means you will not be attending the event. If you have teammates who have not received the option to confirm their attendance, please first choose <strong>Yes</strong> below, then email <a href="mailto:info@revolutionuc.com">info@revolutionuc.com</a> with their names and the emails they signed up with.</p>

<p>If you select <strong>Yes</strong>, you’ll receive a welcome email with event details. Spots are limited, so confirming early to secure your spot before we reach capacity. If the event fills up, you'll be placed on the waitlist and notified if a spot becomes available. We hope to see you there!</p>

<!-- <p>Note: if you do not confirm your attendance then your spot will automatically be given to a hacker on the waitlist.</p> -->

<p>
  <strong>Important Check-In Information:</strong> Check-in will be open from <strong>10:00 AM to 12:00 PM on March 1</strong>. 
  After check-in ends, we will start admitting attendees from the waitlist in order of who arrived first until we reach maximum capacity. 
  If we reached our capacity and you're still on the waitlist, you are still welcomed to participate in the hackathon, but we won't be able to guarantee food and swags.
</p>
<p>If you are have successfully confirmed your attendance but need to check in late, please email us in advance, and we will hold your spot!</p>

<p><strong>What if I confirm my attendance now and later can&apos;t attend?</strong><br />
Please send us an email at <a href="mailto:info@revolutionuc.com">info@revolutionuc.com</a> to release your spot.</p>

<p><strong>What if I show up to the event without confirming my attendance?</strong><br />
<!-- Since this is a virtual event, you will be able to participate in the event. We just might not be able to give you swag. -->
We will place you on a waitlist. Once the opening ceremony is over, we will verify our capacity and move people from the waitlist in order of who arrived first. If we reach our capacity and you're still on the waitlist, you can still participate, just note that we won't be able to provide you with meals or swag.
