<h3>Virtual</h3>
<p>
  This year, we are hosting the entire hackathon virtually! We want to make sure our participants stay safe. The good news is anyone anywhere can participate since you donâ€™t need to travel to the University of Cincinnati! <br>
  We will be using Discord to host the event and for all the communication and announcements.
