<h3>Discord Login and Check-in</h3>
<p>
  You can use the #checkin channel on our Discord server to check in. Simply go into the #checkin channel, enter your email, and hit Enter (on your keyboard). Revvit, our Discord bot, 
  will search for your registration and grant you access to the rest of the server. If you face any issues, you can talk to us on the #checkin-help channel and we 
  will resolve your issue. Once you are in, get acquainted with our channels!
  <br><br> Here is a youtube video about our Discord which also shows how check in works: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ207VT08qE" target="_blank"><t>RevolutionUC Discord Overview</a>
