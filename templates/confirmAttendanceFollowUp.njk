<p>Thanks for confirming your attendance for RevolutionUC! Here’s what you need to know.</p>

<p><strong>Checking In</strong><br />
Check-in will be in Zimmer Hall. See <a href="https://www.uc.edu/content/dam/common/docs/maps/campus_map_west.pdf" target="_blank">this campus map</a> if you’re unsure where to go. If you arrive after 1:00 PM on Saturday, please go straight to our hacking area in Rhodes 801 instead.</p>

<p><strong>What to Bring</strong><br />
Please bring a valid school ID for check-in, your laptop, phone, or anything else you want to hack on, any chargers for your device(s), and a positive attitude! We also recommend bringing basic toiletries (toothbrush, deodorant, etc), a pillow/blanket (if you choose to nap). Please note that Ethernet access will be limited, <em>so plan to use a Wi-Fi connection.</em></p>

<p><strong>Teams and Hacking</strong><br />
The maximum team size is four. Don’t have a team? No worries! We’ll have a team building session after the opening ceremony. Note: you can bring an idea to the hackathon, but all hacking on your project must be done at the hackathon.</p>

<p><strong>Parking</strong><br />
UC has plenty of parking garages! For a full list, check out the university’s <a href="https://www.uc.edu/parking/visitors-maps.html" target="_blank">Maps and Visitor Information page</a>. The hackathon occurs on West Campus, so we would recommend parking at <a href="https://www.uc.edu/parking/visitors-maps.html#wa" target="_blank">Woodside Garage</a> or <a href="https://www.uc.edu/parking/visitors-maps.html#cg" target="_blank">Campus Green Garage</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Food</strong><br />
We will be serving lunch, dinner, and a midnight snack on Saturday, along with breakfast and lunch on Sunday. Vegetarian and vegan options are included in every meal. Various snacks and drinks will be available throughout the event.</p>

<p><strong>Travel Reimbursement</strong><br />
We offer carpool reimbursement on a case by case basis - receipts must be provided to receive travel reimbursement. We don’t offer reimbursement for flights. As a standard rule, we’ll reimburse 15 cents per mile between UC and your school, up to $60 for a car with more than one participant, or $40 if traveling alone. If we have more reimbursement requests than anticipated, we’ll drop the per mile rate fairly to accommodate all reimbursement applicants. You’ll be able to apply for travel reimbursement following the event. If you’d like more information please do not hesitate to email us at <a href="mailto:info@revolutionuc.com">info@revolutionuc.com</a>.</p>
