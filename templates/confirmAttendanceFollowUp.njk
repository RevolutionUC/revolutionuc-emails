<p>Thanks for confirming your attendance for RevolutionUC! Here’s what you need to know.</p>


<h3>Checking In</h3>
<p>
  Check-in will be open from <strong>10:00 AM to 12:00 PM on March 1</strong>. 
  If you need to check in late, please email us in advance, and we will hold your spot!
</p>
<p>Check-in will be on the first floor of the 1819 Innovation Hub building (2900 Reading Rd, Cincinnati, OH 45206). If you're unsure where to go, we will have signs posted in the main lobby to help direct you to our check-in stations.</p>

<p><strong>What to Bring</strong><br />
Please bring a valid school ID for check-in, your laptop, phone, or anything else you want to hack on, any chargers for your device(s), and a positive attitude! Please bring your own water bottles as well! We also recommend bringing basic toiletries (toothbrush, deodorant, etc), a pillow/blanket (if you choose to nap). Please note that Ethernet access will be limited, <em>so plan to use a Wi-Fi connection.</em></p>

<p><strong>Teams and Hacking</strong><br />
The maximum team size is four. Don’t have a team? No worries! We’ll have a team building session after the opening ceremony. Note: you can bring an idea to the hackathon, but all hacking on your project must be done at the hackathon.</p>
